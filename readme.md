#  Tabinikki for WP

## July 31th, 2013 update

Initial commit of the theme. 

## What is it?

Tabinikki (旅日記) means "Travel Diary" in Japanese. It's a free theme for Wordpress.  

You can see a live demo [here](http://www.matmm.me/tabinikki/demo/).

## How to install this? 

Well, if you already have an hosting platform and Wordpress installed on it: just download Tabinikki and upload the whole folder in wp-content/themes/ then activate it in your Wordpress Admin (Appearence/Themes). Done. 

If you want your gravatar to be at a 64x64 pixels like in my demo, open the comment-template.php in wp-include and change the number accordingly somewhere around the line 1421. 

Finally, I used the WP-Menu function in Tabinikki so you're free to customize your navigation menu directly from your Admin Panel (Appearance/Menu). 

#### Tabinikki is light and responsive

I made this theme with bloggers and travelers in mind. The layout is really simple and will fit any display. 

#### Tabinikki uses Georgia and Helvetica Neue 

This theme extensively uses the Georgia typeface. This typeface has proven to be one of the most readable (and beautiful, imho) serif typeface included from start in all decent modern computers (Mac, PC, Linux). Nevertheless, Georgia might be a little bit hard to read on low-quality smartphones displays; therefore, I'd probably change it for a better web-font such as: 

* [FF Meta Serif Web Pro](https://typekit.com/fonts/ff-meta-serif-web-pro)
* [FF Tisa Web Pro](https://typekit.com/fonts/ff-tisa-web-pro)

Or even a modern serif like:

* [Merriweather](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/merriweather)

A sans-serif could do just fine as well but for long posts, I personnally always fancy a beautiful serif ;)

#### Tabinikki is easily cusomizable 

Provided that you're a bit familiar with CSS! I made sure that the PHP files and stylesheet are well commented out so it's easier for novice DIYers like me to customize the theme in less than 10/15 minutes. 

## HTML 5 Reset Wordpress Theme

The HTML5 Reset WordPress theme is a blank theme based on the [HTML5 Reset templates](https://github.com/murtaugh/HTML5-Reset). It's a great empty slate upon which to build your own HTML5-based WordPress themes. Used it as a CSS reset, removed the options but kept most of the loops.
